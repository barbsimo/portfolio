          Mushrooms Found Fall 2016

          My first season as an amature mycologist (so believe identification at your own risk, but I am still here to tell.)

        <div class="col-sm-2">King Bolete (Boletus edulis) </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="http://mushroaming.com/images/87382010.jpg" alt="Bolete"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">Found in woods at about 3000 to 4000 feet in fall. Spores under cap (verses gills). "Many connoisseurs regarded this mushroom as the best, something I wouldn't argue about. I just love the nutty taste and consistency of this impressive mushroom."</div>

        <div class="col-sm-2">Pacific Golden Chanterelle (Cantharellus formosus)</div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="http://mushroaming.com/images/879e9510.jpg" alt="Chanterelle"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">The Golden chanterelle is the most abundant of all coastal chanterelles in the Pacific Northwest. There is no other place on this globe that offers a comparable chanterelles bounty as does the Pacific Northwest. This is Chanterelle heaven, no doubt!</div>

        <div class="col-sm-2">Shaggy Parasol.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="http://mushroaming.com/images/113cd1380.jpg" alt="Parasol"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">Found in many forests and backyards. Some say it's the most abundant tasty backyard mushroom in the PNW. A word of advice: cook and eat it soon after harvesting. It ages quickly after picking.</div>

        <div class="col-sm-2">Winter Chanterelle (Craterellus tubaeformis)</div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="http://mushroaming.com/images/76b58bc0.jpg" alt="Winter Chanterelle"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">Found a bit later in the year - hence it's name. Grows in mossy areas. If you find one there are likely many more around, which is god because it's small and you'll want a lot of them! As with most chenterelles, dry fry it a bit before adding butter or olive oil. Much more palateable / less slimey.</div>

        <div class="col-sm-2">Matsutake or Pine Mushroom (Tricholoma magnielare)</div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="http://mushroaming.com/images/101fce920.jpg" alt="Matsutake"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">One test for identifying this mushroom is the "wiggle test". Give it a push and notice how solid it is - does not wiggle. If you are fortunate and find this mushroom remember where the location becuase it will fruit for many years in the same place. </div>
